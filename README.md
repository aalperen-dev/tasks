# ðŸš€ Job Interview Tasks (Flutter)

This repository is a curated collection of coding tasks and small projects that Iâ€™ve completed as part of technical assessments and job interview processes. All tasks are implemented using **Flutter**, and they reflect my approach to building responsive, efficient, and maintainable mobile applications.

## ðŸ“¦ About the Repository

Each directory in this repository represents a **standalone Flutter project**. These tasks vary in scope and complexity, ranging from UI challenges to API integrations and full feature implementations.

While I can't publicly share company-specific details or confidential requirements, the implementations here represent generalized versions or reproductions of the original tasks.

These projects demonstrate:

- Building clean and scalable Flutter UI
- Using effective state management techniques
- Structuring and organizing Flutter code for readability and maintenance
- Applying architectural patterns like MVVM, Clean Architecture, or BLoC (depending on the task)
